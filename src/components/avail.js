            Separate Living Areas: Unlike standard hotel rooms, apartment rooms
            often have separate areas for sleeping, living, and dining, offering
            more space and privacy. Kitchen or Kitchenette: Many apartment rooms
            include a fully equipped kitchen or kitchenette, allowing guests to
            prepare their own meals. Multiple Bedrooms: Larger apartment-style
            rooms may have one or more separate bedrooms, making them ideal for
            families or groups of friends. Extended Amenities: These rooms might
            also include features like a washing machine, dishwasher, larger
            bathrooms, and storage spaces. Home-Like Feel: Apartment rooms are
            designed to feel more like a home than a traditional hotel room,
            often furnished with comfortable sofas, dining tables, and sometimes
            even balconies or terraces.

            Separate Living Area: Unlike standard rooms, suites usually feature
            a separate living or sitting area in addition to the bedroom. This
            living space often includes comfortable seating, such as sofas and
            chairs, and sometimes a dining table. Larger Space: Suites are
            generally more spacious, offering more square footage than regular
            rooms. This makes them ideal for travelers seeking extra comfort or
            for families, couples, or business travelers needing extra space.
            Premium Amenities: Suites often come with upgraded amenities, such
            as larger TVs, enhanced bathroom features (like Jacuzzi tubs or rain
            showers), high-end toiletries, and more elaborate furniture.
            Multiple Rooms: Some suites may have more than one bedroom or a
            designated work area, making them ideal for longer stays or guests
            seeking added privacy. Kitchenette or Full Kitchen: In some cases,
            suites may include a kitchenette or full kitchen, allowing guests to
            prepare their own meals. Exclusive Services: Guests staying in
            suites may receive special services such as complimentary access to
            hotel lounges, VIP check-in, personalized concierge service, and
            higher levels of room service.
